Package: spm12-common
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Recommends: spm12-data, spm12-doc
Description: analysis of brain imaging data sequences
 Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) refers to the construction and assessment
 of spatially extended statistical processes used to test hypotheses about
 functional brain imaging data. These ideas have been instantiated in software
 that is called SPM. It is designed for the analysis of fMRI, PET, SPECT, EEG
 and MEG data.
 .
 This package provides the platform-independent M-files.

Description: data files for SPM12
 Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) refers to the construction and assessment
 of spatially extended statistical processes used to test hypotheses about
 functional brain imaging data. These ideas have been instantiated in software
 that is called SPM. It is designed for the analysis of fMRI, PET, SPECT, EEG
 and MEG data.
 .
 This package provide the data files shipped with the SPM distribution, such as
 various stereotaxic brain space templates and EEG channel setups.

Description: manual for SPM12
 Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) refers to the construction and assessment
 of spatially extended statistical processes used to test hypotheses about
 functional brain imaging data. These ideas have been instantiated in software
 that is called SPM. It is designed for the analysis of fMRI, PET, SPECT, EEG
 and MEG data.
 .
 This package provides the SPM manual in PDF format.

#Description: analysis of brain imaging data sequences for GNU Octave
# Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) refers to the construction and assessment
# of spatially extended statistical processes used to test hypotheses about
# functional brain imaging data. These ideas have been instantiated in software
# that is called SPM. It is designed for the analysis of fMRI, PET, SPECT, EEG

# This package provides SPM to be used with GNU Octave. Note that only a very small
# subset of SPM12 functionality works with Octave right now. This package is
# primarily provided to facilitate porting SPM to GNU Octave.

Description: analysis of brain imaging data sequences for MATLAB
 Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) refers to the construction and assessment
 of spatially extended statistical processes used to test hypotheses about
 functional brain imaging data. These ideas have been instantiated in software
 that is called SPM. It is designed for the analysis of fMRI, PET, SPECT, EEG
 and MEG data.
 .
 This package provides SPM to be used with MATLAB. Note that this package
 depends on MATLAB -- a commercial software that needs to be obtained and
 installed separately.
