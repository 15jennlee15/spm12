MATLAB SPM12 for Debian
-----------------------

The Debian package of SPM12 doesn't ship any pre-compiled MEX extensions. These
extensions are automatically built when installing the matlab-spm12 package.

To use SPM12 with MATLAB it has to be added to its search path. The
corresponding installation directory is /usr/share/matlab/site/m/spm12. Adding

  addpath('/usr/share/matlab/site/m/spm12')

to a user'sÂ "startup.m" or the system-wide MATLAB configuration will enable
SPM12. Alternatively, a 'spm12-matlab' command is provided that will
automatically configure the search path, start MATLAB and load SPM.
